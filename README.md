# SimpleNN
A simple neural network in Python using only Numpy

For all of the maths and theory behind this simple NN, check out my series of tutorials at: https://mlnotebook.github.io

The series contains:

1. [The maths of a simple NN][1]
2. [Transfer functions][3]
3. [Vectorisation for NN][2]
4. [A simple NN in Python][4]
5. [Performance improvements to the NN][5]

The ideas for the NN came from [Ryan's videos on youtube][6]. I've tried to make some of the maths more obvious and the variables in the network more self-explanatory.

For more turorials and general machine learning interestingness, [follow @MLNotebook on Twitter][7]. For any questions, please end a tweet or use the contact form at https://mlnotebook.github.io/contact
